## About

This tool is designed to make the Dreadnought available more often by authorizing missions for him and making repairs easier. Another key feature is unlocking advanced classes from the beginning, since they appear too late in the game. The final major concept is to let players use the Gladius frigate from the start, adding a fresh dynamic to the game.

Players are expected to progress through the campaign, explore, collect gear, level up, and master the game at a steady pace, keeping the core experience of discovery and challenge. This tool doesn't allow altering in-game currencies, adding items or modifying XP or class perks. It saves time by unlocking things earlier while still keeping the overall enjoyment intact.

## Prerequisites

You need to have the base game installed on your system. DLCs are optional and cannot be unlocked by this tool, buy them first.

This tool does not use or modify any game assets or binaries, nor does it inject anything into the gameâ€™s runtime. It also does not collect or send any data over the internet. All icons used in this tool were sourced from public resources and adapted accordingly.

Please note that this tool does not back up save files, so I recommend doing so manually. If you're using Steam, it's advisable to disable cloud saves.

This tool is available for Windows and Linux and is distributed free of charge. If you encounter a bug, please contact me.

## Getting Started

The Main page is split into two parts. The right side features one-time unlocks, while the left side contains reusable options.

On the Units page all is organized in the same order as they appear in the game. You can view the statuses and information of your units.

When you heal a critical wound, you can add an augmetic using this tool or change existing ones for your knights. Knights cannot have more augmetics than the resilience they have lost. Additionally, you can manage existing talents. Extra talents can be earned through special events, such as A Solitary Duty or The Tournament.

## Known issues

You may still see in-game notifications for purity seals, advanced classes and frigate later in the game. Some unicode symbols used in the given name may be displayed incorrectly in the tool.
